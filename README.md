A web scrapper with node

This repository contains some minor web scrappers I wrote to learn how web scraping works.

It contains two scappers. The `ePLTopScorer.js` scrapes the list of the top 20 scorers in english premier league history. This is based on this [tutorial](https://pusher.com/tutorials/web-scraper-node).

The second, `gitHubScrapper.js`, a personal creation, returns an array of object with the details of the top repositories in a gitHub user's profile.
